# RoboMaster Electrical Onboarding Project
## Overview
This project will take you through the full PCB design process of a boost converter circuit alongside a simple data connection standard. The design process is as follows:

1. Characterization:
   * Defining what the board should do and what problems it needs to solve
2. Schematic creation:
   * Clearly defining circuits and connections without the clutter of physical implementation
3. Simulation:
   * Simulating the circuits defined in the schematic to verify our intentions
4. Board Layout & Routing:
   * Determining an optimal arrangement for components and routing connections, the physical implementation
5. Design Rules Check:
   * Running DRC to verify our implementation is manufacturable and repeating anything in steps 2-4 to resolve issues
6. File Export:
   * Generating gerber files that manufacturers can use to produce the board design

This is an **involved process** and will likely take 3-4 hours, but please put some real time and effort in as you will need every skill you develop here.\
Get started by seeing [the wiki](https://github.com/ut-ras/rm_electrical_onboarding/wiki) for this repo.\
**PLEASE** ask questions in the Onboarding Discussion thread on the Discord, someone else likely has the same question!

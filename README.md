# RoboMaster Electrical Onboarding Project
## Overview
This project will take you through the full PCB design process of a simple buck converter, alongside a few data connection standards, which can be described as:
1. Characterizing requirements
2. Creating & refining the schematic (defining exactly how we want our circuit to work)
3. Laying out  & routing the PCB (physically implementing our circuit)
4. Verifying our design (Running DRC, fixing issues by repeating steps 2 and 3)
5. Generating manufacturing files

This is involved and will likely take ~3 hours, but please put some real time and effort in as you will need every skill you develop here.\
[Get started on the wiki](https://github.com/ut-ras/rm_electrical_onboarding/wiki) for this repo.\
Please ask questions in the Onboarding Discussion thread on the Discord, someone else likely has the same question!

## Repo Structure
Branches:
- `main` is a blank template for you branch off of for your own onboarding project.
- `example` is my implementation of the onboarding project. Feel free to reference it, but try your best to figure things out on your own
- All other branches will be your designs for the onboarding project.
